        <p id="pme">Description: A game to test your knowledge on La Quinta High School. Some questions will be hard, some will not make sense, but by now you should know that life is not fair.</p>
        <h1 id="pme">Questions</h1>
        <p id="pme">1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</p>
        <p id="pme">Some programming concepts and structures I learned is how to hide and show objects that correspoind to their back ground or how to add lives feature to the game.</p>
        <p id="pme">2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</p>
        <p id="pme"> We encountered some struggles such as incoroporating the lives feature into our game and a glitch when clicking our answer choices. To overcome our first struggle, we asked Ms. Terry to help us incorporate the feature and we tried fixing the glitch by moving around the answer choices to see if the result would change.</p>
        <p id="pme">3. What aspects of your game do you like best?</p>
        <p id="pme">The aspects of the game I like the best are our questions. I find them very funny and troll that it entices people to continue the game to see all the questions we came up with.</p>
        <p id="pme">4. If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</p>
        <p id="pme">If we had more time to work on our game. I would love to add more questions, therefore our game would be longer and to fix the glitch our game had. When we selected an answer choice the next question wouldn't appear right away but would take several clicks to process. </p>
