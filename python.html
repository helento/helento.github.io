        <p id="pme">1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your story.</p>
        <p id="pme">Some programming concepts and structures I learned in this unit that I applied to my story is how to incorporate funtions, while loops, and if and elif statements in modern applications. Each concept was essential to create the flow of this interactive story.</p>
        <p id="pme">2. Think back to other stories you read, identify one or two stories you particularly like? Why?</p>
        <p id="pme">One of the stories I particularly liked was Andy's and Justin's story about cuffing season featuring Ms. Terry Nguyen. This story was unique and had a funny story line about 2 males trying to get a date.</p>
